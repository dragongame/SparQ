Installing
==========

SparQ is currently not available in binary versions. There are two versions
of SparQ available:

  * pre-bundled source releases
  * barebones development version (fresh from GitHub)

Installing from a pre-bundled source release 
--------------------------------------------
This is the easiest way. To install and use SparQ, you need

 * gcc and g++, version 2.95 or higher
 * GNU libtool, version 1.4.3 or higher
 * Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), version 0.9.10 or higher

To build a working version of SparQ enter the SparQ directory and run

./configure

Usually, no errors should occur and you should be able to build the
SparQ executables by running

make

All executables will be installed within the SparQ directory. Please
note that you have to recompile SparQ if you move the directory to
another place.

Further instructions can be found in the SparQ Manual. If you encounter
any problems during the build process, please contact the authors. 


Installing SparQ on MacOS X 
---------------------------

Some of the portings of GNU libtool to MacOS X are buggy. 
SparQ, however, relies on libtool to build dynamic libraries.

If you are using MacOS X, please try the following:

 1. Run './configure' as usual
 2. Run './patch-libtool' (this implies only local modifications
    and does not change anything on your system).
 3. Run 'make'

This is known to work on Darwin with libtool 1.5.10.


Installing from development version
-----------------------------------

There's only one difference to the convenient version: you first need to
run autogen.sh to generate the configure file. Since you're a developer,
you knew this anyway...
