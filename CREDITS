SparQ's development has started in context of the research project 
"Q-Shape: reasoning about paths, shapes, and configurations" 
as part of the transregional collaborative research center on
spatial cognition. Financial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft 
is gratefully acknowledged. 

The people behind SparQ are:

Frank Dylla           - calculi and qualification libraries
Lutz Frommberger      - script and make magic, OPRA composition library
Jae Hee Lee           - OPRA composition library
Jan Oliver Wallgruen  - calculi, testing, and neighborhood-based reasoning
Diedrich Wolter       - the rest
